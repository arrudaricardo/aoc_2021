My [Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) 2021 solutions, different PL per day

Day One - Clojure ✔️
- [ClojureDocs]( https://clojuredocs.org/ ) documentation has community exemples that helps to understand Clojure Lib and use cases.
- Java method needed to be wrap in a anon function to work as reduce argument.

Day Two - Erlang ✔️
- Erlang [Docs](https://www.erlang.org/doc) are easy to read and understand.
- Decided to use recursion to solve, recursion are easy to write due the pattern match and function overload syntax.
- Compiler error message are bad formatted, hard to read, and not helpful. 

Day Three - Ruby ✔️
- Solved in naive imperative style, I sure could be solved using fancy Binary arithmetics
- Error messages are informative and succinct
- I feel like Ruby is more elegant, user friendly and readable than Python, just don't have a great std lib like Python.
